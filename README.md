# Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate Damage Calculator
Work in progress. Dumb little page to give you the actual damage for an attack given power, move and effectiveness.

So far you can select a weapon to auto-populate the attack (and true attack i.e. power) and moves (i.e. motion).
Effectiveness is defaulted to 65 but can be changed along with attack value.

## Weapons Supported
* Gunlance
